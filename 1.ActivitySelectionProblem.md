## ðŸ“˜ Activity Selection Problem â€“ Notes

### ðŸ”¸ Problem Statement:

### Given `n` activities with their **start** and **finish** times, select the maximum number of **non-overlapping activities** that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Greedy Strategy:

### * **Always pick the activity with the earliest finish time** that doesn't conflict with previously selected ones.

* Sort all activities by their **finish time**, and apply a greedy approach.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Why Pick the First (Earliest Finish) Activity?

### * Any optimal solution that doesnâ€™t start with the first (earliest finishing) activity can be transformed into one that does without reducing the total number of activities.

* This **greedy choice** ensures the most time is left for future selections.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Algorithm Steps:

### 1. Create pairs of (finish, start) times.

2. Sort these pairs by **finish time**.

3. Initialize `finishtime = -1` and `count = 0`.

4. For each activity:

   * If its start time > `finishtime`, include it and update `finishtime`.

### ðŸ”¸ Java Code (with User Input):
```
import java.util.*;

class GfG {

    static int activitySelection(int[] start, int[] finish) {
        int n = start.length;
        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i][0] = finish[i];
            arr[i][1] = start[i];
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int finishtime = -1, count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i][1] > finishtime) {
                finishtime = arr[i][0];
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter number of activities: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        int[] start = new int[n], finish = new int[n];

        System.out.println("Enter start times:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) start[i] = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter finish times:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) finish[i] = sc.nextInt();

        int result = activitySelection(start, finish);
        System.out.println("Maximum number of non-overlapping activities: " + result);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”¸ Key Takeaways:

### * This is a classic **greedy problem**.

* Sorting by finish time guarantees the best chance to maximize activity count.

* Java's `Arrays.sort()` with custom comparator is used for sorting pairs.

* Used in real-world scheduling, job sequencing, and CPU allocation problems.
